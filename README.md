## Script is Outdated, Please Use the genBTC version.
<b>Message from the AUTOTRIMPS Editor (genBTC):</b> You are currently browsing the zininzinin version. The genBTC version is more current. I have been designated the official maintainer of this branch for a while now (June 2016), and have been running my own repository since April. The zininzinin branch is usually way behind. Any work I do on the script will be going into the <b><a href="https://github.com/genbtc/AutoTrimps/">genBTC version linked here.</a></b> Please make note that this zininzinin branch is as a backup only, in case I break the genBTC version you can revert to using this one in the few hours it takes for me to fix a bug.
